Hello There 🍇🍇

My name is Rosely, I’m from Venezuela 🇻🇪, living in Spain 🇪🇸.

I have a degree in Chemistry Science 🧪, With more than 2 years of experience in the physicochemical analysis of raw
materials, in-process and finished products area. Additionally, I’ve participated in the research, development,
innovation, and quality assurance for cleaning area products and personal and oral care products 🧼. Currently, I
have a particular interest in developing myself in the technology world, such as programming 👩‍💻.
